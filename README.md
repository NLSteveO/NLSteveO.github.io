This is the repository for my website using GitHub pages. My GitHub username is NLSteveO and my name is Stephen O'Keefe, I am a Software Developer and a graduate of [Computer Science](http://www.mun.ca/computerscience/) from [Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador](http://www.mun.ca/). I built my website off of the theme iCard-Resume, which is a theme built on top of bootstrap and other freely available libraries. Its aimed to provide a fully furnished Jekyll theme for a personal resume.

*NOTE:* I have plans for rebuilding this website.
